## What it is and how does it work?

This webpage intends to be a fully functioning and reliable timer for those that would like to work more productivelly using the Pomodoro Technique.
It features 3 different timers - one for each sprint of the technique, a note-taking area for convenience, spotify integration to minimize distractions, and, finally, a log system that keeps track of the user's last timer sessions.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro.

#### 1. Start the pomodoro timer (25 minutes).
#### 2. Work on the task you planned.
#### 3. When the timer finishes, take a short break (5 minutes) by clicking the "5 min break" button.
#### 4. Repeat until you've completed 3 pomodoros.
#### 5. After completing the fourth pomodoro, take a long break (20 minutes) by clicking the "20 min break" button.
